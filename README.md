# Spoolhive

What filament you own, what is loaded in which printer, and what is still sealed —
a phone-first app that runs on GitHub Pages with no server and no accounts.

Built for two Bambu Lab printers (**Maker Bee**, a P1S with an AMS, and **Maker Ant**,
an A1 mini), but printers are records you can add, rename and re-spec, so it copes
with a third machine or the mini growing an AMS lite.

## How it works

- **The data is a file.** `data/inventory.json` in this repo is the whole inventory.
- **Reading needs nothing.** Anyone with the link sees the current state; the app
  reads the file through the public GitHub API.
- **Editing needs a token.** Paste a fine-grained personal access token once on the
  Sync screen. It is kept in that browser's `localStorage`, sent only to github.com,
  and never leaves your device otherwise — there is no server to send it to.
- **Without one the app is a viewer,** not a broken editor. Every control that
  changes something is gone: no Add tab, no eject on a loaded slot, no empty slot
  to tap, no mount or remove. The spool screen still shows level, location,
  moisture and notes, just as readings rather than fields. Routes that exist only
  to change something (`/add`, `/printer/:id`, `/load/…`, `/recolor/:id`) redirect
  home, so a typed URL or an old link cannot land on a dead screen. There is no
  banner about any of this — a viewer is not missing anything they came for.
- **Every save is a commit,** so the inventory has a full history you can roll back
  from GitHub's UI.
- **It works offline.** The app is a PWA: the last synced copy opens without signal
  and edits queue until you are back.

## Setup

1. Push this repo to GitHub as a **public** repo (Pages on a private repo needs a
   paid plan).
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set *Source* to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys.
4. Open `https://<you>.github.io/spoolhive/`. The app works out which repo it lives in
   from that URL, so there is nothing to configure.
5. Create a token at **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens**:
   - *Repository access*: only this repository
   - *Permissions → Contents*: **Read and write**
6. Paste it on the Sync screen. Editing unlocks.

Saving the inventory commits `data/inventory.json`, which the deploy workflow
deliberately ignores — the app reads that file at runtime, so edits show up
immediately instead of waiting for a rebuild.

## The colour catalogue

`src/catalog.generated.json` holds 350 colours with real hex values, so a swatch
in the app matches what you saw when you bought the filament — 194 Bambu Lab
across 18 ranges and 156 Elegoo across 16. Only PLA, PETG, TPU and ASA ranges are
kept; `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` cuts the rest, folds duplicate ranges and
spellings together, and adds the hand-kept colours in `data/catalog-extra.json`
(Elegoo's own table has no "Transparent", for one).

Four sources, merged in this order of authority:

| Source | What it gives |
| --- | --- |
| Bambu Lab's published hex tables | official colours, one line per PDF, one PDF each |
| elegoo.com | their own ranges, swatch table and swatch images |
| [SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB) | Broad community coverage, including co-extruded multi-colour |
| [filamentcolors.xyz](https://filamentcolors.xyz) | Measured from printed swatches; fills what is left |

Elegoo run a Shopify store, so the ranges and colour options come from
`products.json`, and the hex values from the theme's swatch table, which is
embedded in every product page and identical on all of them.

### Reading the effect ranges

Galaxy, Sparkle, Marble and the multi-colour silks are not flat colours, so
Elegoo serve them as a swatch *image* instead of a hex. Those images are
decoded and sampled (`scripts/lib/png.mjs` — a small PNG reader on node's own
zlib, so the build needs no image dependencies) and the colours read out of the
pixels.

The sampler reports whether it is sure. Two clean bands, or one flat colour,
it trusts. A gradient that averages to a colour appearing nowhere on the reel
it flags as unsure, and those rows sort *below* the community sources so a
listed pair of colours wins over an invented average. Sanity check: Elegoo's
own `blue&red` swatch image samples to `#EA140E` and `#2240AF` — exactly the
flat hexes their swatch table gives for Red and Blue.

Bambu needed no sampling: they publish a flat hex table per product line, so
going to the source was enough.

Both community sources file everything under a bare family (`PLA`) and put the
range in the colour name (`Matte Ivory White`, `RAPID PETG Blue`). The build
splits those apart, then drops a range word the material already carries, so
`PLA Silk / Silk Gold` becomes `PLA Silk / Gold`.

Co-extruded filament keeps every colour it has. A dual-colour silk draws as hard
bands rather than a blend, because a blend would invent a colour that is not on
the reel.

Regenerate it with:

```bash
node scripts/build-catalog.mjs              # rebuild from data/catalog-raw.json
node scripts/build-catalog.mjs --refresh    # re-pull elegoo.com, SpoolmanDB, filamentcolors
python3 scripts/fetch-bambu-pdfs.py         # re-parse Bambu's 20 PDFs (needs pypdf)
```

Anything not in the catalogue goes in by hand with a colour picker.

## Data model

```jsonc
{
  "printers": [{ "id", "name", "model", "amsUnits", "slotsPerUnit" }],
  "spools": [{
    "id", "brand", "material", "colorName", "hex",
    "form": "spool | refill",   // refill = spool-less filament
    "mounted": false,            // a refill sitting on a reusable spool
    "netWeightG", "remainingPct", "sealed", "openedAt",
    "dryState": "dry | needs-drying | drying",
    "location": { "kind": "ams", "printer": "maker-bee", "slot": 3 }
  }],
  "emptySpools": 2               // reusable spools free for the next refill
}
```

`amsUnits: 0` means a single direct feed. Fitting a unit moves the spool already in
the printer into slot 1; removing one keeps slot 1 on the direct feed and sends the
rest back to storage. Removing a printer never deletes filament — its spools move to
storage.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

On `localhost` there is no repo to detect, so set owner/repo by hand on the Sync
screen — or just work offline against the local cache.

```bash
npm run build       # type-check and bundle
npm run typecheck
```
